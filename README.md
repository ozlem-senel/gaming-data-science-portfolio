# gaming-data-science-portfolio


This repository contains a  set of data science and analytics projects 
focused on **mobile games** and **player behavior**.

## Goals

- Show my ability to work with realistic game / app datasets
- Demonstrate end-to-end analytics: from SQL and Python to modeling and storytelling
- Build a high-impact portfolio demonstrating the skills needed to excel in mobile gaming analytics, product data science, and game economy insights.
  
## Project Structure

- `player_retention/` – D1/D7/D30 retention, cohorts, churn flags
- `level_funnel/` – Level progression, bottleneck detection, difficulty curve
- `churn_prediction/` – Churn models (XGBoost + SHAP)
- `ltv_prediction/` – LTV modeling and monetization analytics
- `level_difficulty/` – Level difficulty estimator
- `game_economy_anomaly/` – Revenue / ARPU anomaly detection
- `notebooks/` – Shared exploration notebooks
- `assets/` – Figures used in the portfolio and blog posts

More details will be added as projects progress.
